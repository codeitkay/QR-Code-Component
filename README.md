- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I definitely learned a lot while completing this project! This is my first project that included writing code from only an image. Seeing the finished product is great but the journey was definitely a long one! I had the hardest time with centering my div but after reading more about centering, I was able to get the hang of it. I'm really proud of what I completed and excited on ways I can update and modify this project to make it more dynamic.


### Continued development

One of the things I want to improve on is my efficiency when centering objects. I definitely had a rough time creating a responsive centered QR code. 
Additionally, flexbox is something that I can already tell is a gamechanger once I get the hang of it! 
One of the things I want to add is a "dark" and "light" mode button that will change the coloring of the CSS when a user clicks the button. Another feature that I would like to add is for the QR image to get a little bigger if the mouse hovers over any portion of my QR component div.


### Useful resources

- [30 Seconds of Code](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/css/s/transform-centering) - This helped me understand how to responsively center elements in CSS while using transform: translate. A massive game changer for me honestly.
- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - Freecodecamp is legendary and this article about centering a div was a life saver! I personally appreciated the colored code and visual examples provided. This really helped me visualize everything and what line of code was responsible for.
